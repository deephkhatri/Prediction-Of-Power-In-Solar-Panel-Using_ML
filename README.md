# Prediction-Of-Power-In-Solar-Panel-Using_ML

## Description

This project aims to predict the **AC_Power** generated by a solar panel based on various input parameters such as DC voltage, current, ambient temperature, module temperature, and infrared (IR) intensity. The implementation utilizes multiple machine learning models to enhance prediction accuracy, including:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Decision Tree**
- **XGBoost**
- **LightGBM**
- **k-NN Regression**

Additionally, the project features a **user input interface** that allows users to enter the relevant parameters and predict the **AC_Power** values using different models, providing flexibility in model selection for predictions.

## Features

- **Multiple ML models** to predict power generation from solar panels.
- **User input interface** for real-time predictions.
- Comparison of model performance based on prediction accuracy.
